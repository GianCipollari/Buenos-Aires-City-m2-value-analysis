# Analysis of Square Meter Value in Buenos Aires

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to analyze the **value of the square meter** in different communes of Buenos Aires City, using open data and **data analysis** tools. **Machine learning** techniques and **interactive visualizations** were applied to identify factors affecting property prices, such as access to public transportation, family income, and other socioeconomic indicators.

The project was carried out using **Python** (with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.) and **Tableau** for visualizations. **Six interactive dashboards** were developed in Tableau to illustrate different aspects of the analysis.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following elements:

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) that include exploratory analysis, data preprocessing, modeling, and visualizations generated in Python.
- **data/**: Data files used for the analysis. Includes a dataset (.csv) created by me that also contains the sources of the information.
- **scripts/**: A Python script file.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides general information about the project.
- **images/**: Images and screenshots of the visualizations created, used for documentation purposes.
- **requirements.txt**: File with the necessary dependencies to run the project.

## Analysis Objectives

- To get a job as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, or Machine Learning Engineer.&#x20;
- **Understand how different socioeconomic and infrastructure factors affect the square meter value** in different communes of Buenos Aires.
- **Identify patterns and trends** that help explain the differences in prices between communes.
- **Build a predictive model** using Random Forest to learn why the value of the square meter change according the characteristics of each commune.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis and Machine Learning (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- **Tableau**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documentation and execution of code

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Cleaning and analysis of the dataset to understand key trends and relationships.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, standardizing variables, and performing categorical transformations using one hot encoding and dummies.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Using the **Random Forest** algorithm to predict the value of the square meter, followed by optimization through **Grid Search**.
4. **Visualization**: Creating **interactive dashboards** in Tableau to communicate key insights.

## Main Results

- The Random Forest model developed has an **RÂ² Score of 0.92**, indicating that the model can explain 92% of the variability in the square meter value across different communes.

- Amenities such as general hospitals, green spaces, and educational institutions do not have an impact on the square meter value. Interestingly, the number of sports clubs has a positive correlation.

- The **importance of features**, according to the model, suggests that rental prices and family income are the main factors influencing the square meter value.

## How to Run the Project
